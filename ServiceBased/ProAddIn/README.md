# Workflow Manager ArcGIS Pro Add-In Sample

This ArcGIS Pro Add-In sample utilizes the Workflow Manager Pro SDK to perform various operations against ArcGIS Workflow Manager workflow items.

## Prerequisite
Setup a development environment for building a Pro Add-In.

Refer to the ArcGIS Pro SDK [Build your first add-in - Prerequisites](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/arcgis-add-ins-and-automation/arcgis-pro/tutorials/build-your-first-add-in/#prerequisites) doc for installing the necessary prerequisites.

## Build
1. Open the project in Visual Studio
2. Update the ArcGIS Pro installation path in the following files if necessary. This is needed if ArcGIS Pro is installed in a different location than _C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro_.
   * WorkflowManagerSampleAddIn.csproj
   * Config.daml
   * launchSettings.json
3. Update jobId and stepId information for your workflow item
   * Some samples include specific jobId and stepId properties which are unique to a workflow item. Update these values before running these samples.
4. Build and run the project in Visual Studio
   * The Workflow Manager Add-In should now be visible in ArcGIS Pro under the _Workflow Manager Add-In_ tab
   * The built add-in will be located at _C:\Users\<username>\Documents\ArcGIS\AddIns\ArcGISPro_
